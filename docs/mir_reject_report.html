<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Data Overview</h2>
<p>The data used for this report is pre-aggregated count data. The data
is aggregated by a number of trip attributes - e.g. when and where the
trip occurred, etc. This aggregation was performed to limit the size of
the data and make it easier to manage across different platforms.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
