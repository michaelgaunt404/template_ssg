Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Data Overview</h2>
<p>The data used for this report is pre-aggregated count data. The data
is aggregated by a number of trip attributes - e.g. when and where the
trip occurred, etc. This aggregation was performed to limit the size of
the data and make it easier to manage across different platforms.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
