Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Data Overview</h2>
<p>The data used for this report is pre-aggregated count data. The data
is aggregated by a number of trip attributes - e.g. when and where the
trip occurred, etc. This aggregation was performed to limit the size of
the data and make it easier to manage across different platforms.</p>

<h2>SQL Query</h2>
<p>Query uses the following tables to describe download issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rtoll.toll/toll_status</code>: to define when/where trip
occurred and its status<br />
</li>
<li><code>qfree.imagereviewrequest/result</code>: to define image review
request status for Type-1 trips<br />
</li>
<li>these tables are currently used to monitor image review request
process in a separate report<br />
</li>
<li><code>lance.TripPassageImageDownloadResponse/Request</code>: to
define download status
<ul>
<li>these tables were found somewhat recently and indicate image
download status<br />
</li>
<li>these tables are joined together and then aggregated<br />
</li>
<li>aggregation counts number of successful/unsuccessful/null image

<h2>Photo-Enforced Trips Image Download Queue</h2>
<p>This section details image download counts by toll status -
specifically, focusing on the <em>015-PENIMGDWLD</em> status. Most of
the trips are type-1 trips with a very small subset of trips being
type-2 transponders. These counts indicate trips that will eventually
sent to QFree for IRR.</p>

<h2>Image Download Requests</h2>
<p>This section details the state of the image download process with the
count attributes described in the <a href="#data">Data Overview</a>
above. This section does this in two ways - by reporting counts of image
download requests or trips. A single trip will have multiple image
download requests, so the total number of image download requests for a
given day/roadway will far exceed that of the actual number of
trips.</p>
<div id="counts-by-requests" class="section level3 tabset">
<h3 class="tabset">Counts by Requests</h3>
<p>The plots below detail the total number of image download requests
per status.</p>
<p>Status Description:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ttl_downloaded_t</code>: successful image download requests
which have an image associated with them</li>
<li><code>ttl_downloaded_f</code>: failed image download requests which
do not have an image associated with them</li>
<li><code>ttl_nullstatus</code>: image download requests that have a
NULL status - neither a failed or successful request</li>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
