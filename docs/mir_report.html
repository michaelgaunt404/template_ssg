The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This is the first attempt at an ICRS report. The intent of this
document is to provide some context to the data queried by the new ICRS
query.</p>
<p>This document is under development and will act as a report as well
as a template that will be used for reoccurring analyses. Some of the
content may be holdover analysis artifacts.</p>
<p>The data used for this analysis extends from <code>2023-01-13</code>
to <code>2023-02-26</code>.<br />
It was queried on <code>2023-02-27</code>.</p>

<h2>Data Overview</h2>
<p>The data used for this report is pre-aggregated count data. The data
is aggregated by a number of trip attributes - e.g. when and where the
trip occurred, etc. This aggregation was performed to limit the size of
the data and make it easier to manage across different platforms.</p>

<h2>IRR Processing Rates</h2>
<p>This section quantifies the time to identify plates in a number of
ways. The methods used to quantify this output is describe by the bullet
points below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendor: the number of days a trip is held by a vendor</li>
<li>Cumulative Plate Identification Time: the number of days it took a
trip to reach a specific processing stage/milestone
<ul>
<li><code>Created in ETAN</code>: time difference (in days) between when
a trip occurred and when it was entered in ETAN database</li>
<li><code>IRR Requested</code>: time difference (in days) between when a
trip occurred and when it was sent to QFREE for IRR</li>
<li><code>Plate Identified</code>: time difference (in days) between
when a trip occurred and when plate identification was received by ETAN
from QFREE</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FREE Detailed Process: the number of days it took QFREE to identify
a plate by plate identification method - AutoPass, MIR, or Rereview</li>

<h3>Plate Identification Duration Counts</h3>
<p>The plot details counts of trips given days with vendor - Kapsch,
ETAN, or Qfree - per trip occurrence week. Time spent with vendor has
been discretized into discrete bins for visual clarity.</p>
<p>Example: Kapsch takes 8 days to send a trip to ETAN, this trip falls
into the <em>Between 5 and 10</em> days bin.</p>

<h3 class="tabset">Trip Processing Matrices</h3>
<p>The plots below display aggregated counts of processed trips given
trip occurrence date and processing date. The first tab details counts
with respect to when a trip was fully processed and the second tab
details trips by when they first entered the QFree tables for
processing. The drop down selector can be used to filter points by total
processed trip counts.</p>
<p>*BUG: plots initialize very zoomed out - interaction with drop down
will fix this issue. Permanent fix coming soon.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
