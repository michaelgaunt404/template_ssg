Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/michaelgaunt404/template_ssg/tree/ee682ebeca1b490caffde054168b4cd0f4e68433" target="_blank">ee682eb</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
